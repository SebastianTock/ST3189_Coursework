# ST3189 Machine Learning Coursework

This project was done as my coursework for my degree in data science.

-- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Description

I was expected to present the datasets I am analysing, identify research questions that can be addressed by my analysis and, ideally, present relevant existing literature and contrast the results against it. I was expected to use multiple technique for the regression and classification tasks, and compare their results. (I will only be presenting the code here)

I decided to tackle Students' academic success, as education plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of individuals and societies alike. It acts as a catalyst for both professional and personal development of individuals, opening doors for the possibility of social and economic mobility. Unfortunately, as illustrated by the ongoing issue of student dropouts, not all students have equal access to academic achievements. According to Hanson (2022) up to 32.9% of undergraduates do not complete their degree program, Hanson (2022) also states that on average, college dropouts make 32.6% less income and are 19.6% less likely to be employed than any degree holder.
